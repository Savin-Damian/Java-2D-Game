# Java-2D-Game
Project Context: "În inima Regatului" 
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The game is set in the contemporary era, somewhere in a region called Tammora, ruled by King Visarion. Klim (the main character of the game) works as a guardian of the king, but this job is only temporary, as he plans to betray the king by attempting to seize the queen Raissa's three diamonds, each hidden in three different palaces. Overhearing, by accident, a conversation between the king and one of his closest advisors, in which details about the diamonds and their more precise locations in the three castles are revealed, Klim devises a well-thought-out plan to steal the diamonds and escape the kingdom. However, he cannot do it alone—he needs a trusted ally. Would you help Klim steal the diamonds and escape from the kingdom?
