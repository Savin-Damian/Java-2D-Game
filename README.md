# Java-2D-Game
Project Context: "În inima Regatului" 
The game is set in the contemporary era in a region called Tammora, ruled by King Visarion. Klim, the game's main character, works as a royal guardian—a temporary occupation, as he secretly plans to betray the king. His goal? To steal the three diamonds of Queen Raissa, each hidden in a different palace. 
One day, Klim accidentally overhears a conversation between the king and one of his closest advisors, revealing key details about the diamonds and their precise locations. Seizing the opportunity, he devises a well-thought-out plan to steal the treasures and escape the kingdom. However, he can't do it alone—he needs a trustworthy ally. 
Would you be willing to help Klim steal the diamonds and flee the kingdom?
